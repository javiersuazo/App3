Login in with Facebook
========================

Two models have been created
	- User
	- Authentication
	
The User Model holds info like Name, Email, Password, etc...
The Authentication Model holds the UserID, Social Provider (incase I include Twitter), and UID.

The user selects to login with Facebook ad a few things happen...

1. I check the Authentication table to see if there is an existing record. If so, I find the user in the user table by the UserID value stored in the Authentication table.

2. If there is no match found, I create a new User Record using the values from the Facebook response and also an Authentication record with the new users ID. 

3. When one of those tasks are complete, I then create a session and log the user in.
